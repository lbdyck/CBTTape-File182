                  PDS DIALOG TRAP SERVICE                               00000103
                                                                        00000200
   The PDS Dialog Trap service provides for trapping TSO                00000302
   command output and placing it in the session View Log.               00000402
   This service can be used by TCT and from P86..UX panels.             00000502
                                                                        00000606
   This service uses the TSO/E SYSOUTTRAP service.  This                00000702
   service requires both ISPF 2.3 and TSO/E and the                     00000802
   installation of the PDSTRAP clist.  Tt is recommended that           00000902
   if possible to use this feature.  If ISPF 2.3 (or higher)            00001004
   is not installed this feature will be ignored even if TRAP           00001102
   is set to YES.  If this feature is not active, output from           00001204
   a TSO command requested with the TRAP option will operate            00001302
   without trapping the output, the output will go directly to          00001402
   the users screen in the normal way.  This option can be set          00001502
   by the individual user through the PDS SETTRAP dialog command.       00002002
                                                                        00010000
   To use this service first install the PDSTRAP clist into one         00020003
   of the installation clist libraries that is included in the          00030003
   SYSPROC DD concatenation.  The PDSTRAP clist is in FB-80 format      00040003
   but can be copied using ISPF option 3.3 into ether a FB-80 or        00050002
   VB-255 format library.                                               00060002
                                                                        00061003
** NOTE:  If you are running with the &LOGWIDE global variable          00062003
   set to YES, then COPY the PDSTRAPW clist as PDSTRAP into             00063003
   your SYSPROC concatenation and update the PDSTRAPT test              00064004
   clist with the proper variable and panel names (see comments         00065004
   in clist).                                                           00066004
                                                                        00070002
